# Parallel-Computing
Study for converting serial programs into parallel programs

# Studied algorithm using MPI, pthreads, cuda
* [Smith-waterman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm); the code samples can be applied to other DP algorithms e.g. Edit Distance, Longest Common Subsequence, Shortest Common Supersequence.)
