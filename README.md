# Parallel-Computing
Study for converting serial programs into parallel programs

# Studied algorithm using MPI, pthreads, cuda
* Smith-waterman algorithm; (the approach can be applied to other DP algorithms e.g. Edit Distance, Longest Common Subsequence, Shortest Common Supersequence.)

# Performance benchmarks
